  <div>
    IF THE SOFTWARE IS ALREADY INSTALLED AND LICENSED, YOU HAVE ALREADY AGREED
    TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR SOMEONE HAS DONE SO ON
    YOUR BEHALF.
  </div>

  <div>
    The Software that you are about to access is a structural design and
    analysis tool developed by Computers & Structures, Inc., a California
    corporation (“Vendor”). This End-User Software License Agreement (this
    “Agreement”) sets forth the terms under which you, as an individual or
    entity authorized by Vendor (or, for entities, any employee or agent you
    authorize to use the Software) (“you”), may use the Software.
  </div>

  <div>
    Access to and use of the Software is by permission of Vendor only, and only
    for applicants who accept this Agreement. Vendor may grant or withhold
    approval in its sole discretion.
  </div>
  <div>
    Based on the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, you
    and Vendor agree as follows:
  </div>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        NATURE OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement is a legal contract made between you
        and Vendor. This Agreement contains the terms and conditions with which
        you must comply in order to access and use the Software.
      </li>
      <li>
        LICENSE GRANT. Vendor hereby grants to you one nonexclusive,
        nonassignable, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, nonrefundable and
        nonexchangeable license, for use by you (the purchaser, or your
        employees only) for the term of this Agreement, to access and use the
        Software and any user’s guides, specifications, and other related
        documentation available, whether hard copy or online (the
        “Documentation”), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
        The license allows you to use only one copy of the Software on one
        computer concurrently, whether that computer is physical or virtual. The
        Software may be run by multiple users on one or more machines provided
        enough concurrent user licenses are acquired from Vendor and dedicated
        for each separate user that will run the Software concurrently.
        <div class="ml-6">
          Beta and Trial Version License. Some of the Software may be licensed
          on a beta or trial basis, which may not be used for commercial or
          professional use. Your rights to use beta or trial software are
          limited to the time period specified by Vendor. BETA AND TRIAL
          SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS” and is identified as such on the Sales
          Order confirmation.
        </div>
        <div class="ml-6">
          Academic License. Academic Licenses may be used strictly for
          non-commercial teaching, lesson planning, and research purposes only.
          Academic licenses are identified as such on the Sales Order
          confirmation.
        </div>
        <div class="ml-6">
          Geographic Restriction. The Software may only be used in the country
          identified when the software license was purchased as the country
          where the software will be used. Pre-existing Global Licenses are not
          restricted geographically.
        </div>
        <div class="ml-6">
          License Key. During the term of this Agreement, Vendor periodically
          may issue a license key (file, activation key, internet-based account,
          or other similar method) to enable the Software to execute on the
          computer or server designated by you.
        </div>
        <div class="ml-6">
          Condition of Payment. The license granted herein is conditioned upon
          payment in full for the Software in advance of your use of the
          Software. You will be solely responsible for payment of applicable
          sales and/or use taxes in connection with the sale of Software and
          Services provided under this Agreement unless you provide to Vendor,
          before or at the time that Vendor provides the sales quotation, an
          exemption certificate or other document acceptable to the authority
          imposing the tax, fee or charge.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE. Vendor retains all rights to the Software and the
        Documentation not specifically granted in this Agreement. Vendor owns
        the Software and the Documentation and all copyright and other
        intellectual property rights therein, and this Agreement does not
        transfer to you any title to or any proprietary or intellectual property
        rights in or to the Software, any updates or derivative works thereto,
        or the Documentation, or any copyrights, patent rights, or trademarks
        embodied or used in connection therewith, except for the rights
        expressly granted in this Agreement. The Software and the Documentation
        are protected by United States laws and international treaty provisions.
        YOU MAY NOT USE, COPY, OR MODIFY THE SOFTWARE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART,
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT.
      </li>
      <li>
        RESTRICTIONS. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you shall not (a)
        modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive
        the source code of the Software; (b) rent, lease, loan, sell,
        sublicense, distribute, transmit, network, or otherwise transfer the
        Software access to any third party; (c) make any copy of or otherwise
        reproduce or display the Software (or any of the browser screens
        comprising the Software user interface) except for those copies
        necessarily made by the personal computer and Internet browser that are
        running the Software; (d) use hardware or software to multiplex or pool
        connections, or otherwise allow multiple users or multiple computers or
        devices to access or use the Software indirectly through the licensed
        computer; (e) disclose your license key provided by Vendor; or (f)
        disclose your User ID or Password to any third party. You agree to take
        all reasonable steps to safeguard your User ID and Password for the
        Software so as to ensure that no unauthorized person will have access to
        it, and that no persons authorized to have access will make any
        unauthorized use. You shall promptly report to Vendor any unauthorized
        use of the Software of which you become aware and shall take such
        further steps as may reasonably be requested by Vendor to prevent
        unauthorized use thereof.
      </li>
      <li>
        YOUR OBLIGATIONS. You shall be solely responsible for the following: (a)
        providing all hardware, software, and communications capabilities
        required for use of the Software, as specified by Vendor; (b)
        generating, providing, and loading your data into the Software,
        including, without limitation, historical data to permit you to use the
        Software; and (c) providing and maintaining, at all times during the
        term of this Agreement, the Internet access necessary for your use of
        the Software.
      </li>
      <li>
        TERM AND TERMINATION. The license granted in this Agreement is effective
        in perpetuity, as long as you own the Software License and adhere to the
        terms and conditions of this Agreement. In cases of fixed-term or leased
        licenses, the term of this Agreement coincides with the term of the
        license, which is specified on the order confirmation. The term of this
        Agreement and the license grant herein shall commence on the date you
        agree to this Agreement and install the Software. In the event you
        install a Software upgrade, this license agreement terminates. This
        license shall also terminate automatically on your failure to comply
        with any of the other terms of this Agreement. On termination of this
        Agreement, you agree to promptly discontinue use of the Software,
        deactivate the license key per instructions provided by Vendor, destroy
        all printed copies and delete all electronic copies of any documentation
        that you have downloaded, printed, or created relating to the Software,
        and to ensure that no copies of any of the Software screens, data, or
        other content remain archived or otherwise stored on your computers.
        Notwithstanding termination, the provisions of Sections 3, 6, 7, 8, 9,
        and 10 of this Agreement shall survive and continue to apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          CONFIDENTIALITY. You agree that you shall not disclose to any third
          party the Software or any portion thereof, any technical, product, or
          business information, or any information that Vendor identifies as
          confidential (collectively, “Confidential Information”) related to the
          Software without the prior written consent of Vendor. You shall
          maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information and shall
          not use it for any purpose other than the performance of this
          Agreement.
        </div>
        <div>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not
          include information that you can demonstrate was (a) publicly
          available at the time of disclosure, or later became publicly
          available through no act or omission by you; (b) in your possession
          before disclosure by Vendor; or (c) disclosed to you by a third party
          not in violation of any obligations of confidentiality to Vendor or to
          any third party.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          PRIVACY AND COLLECTION AND DELETION OF PERSONAL OR SYSTEM INFORMATION.
          The Software may employ applications and tools to collect personally
          identifiable, sensitive or other information including personal
          information, network information, geographical information,
          information about the usage of the software, license information (key)
          expiration or machine information (including, but not limited to,
          information regarding the machine, system, disk ID, MAC address),
          collectively “Data.”
        </div>
        <div>
          The collection of this Data may be necessary to you and your users
          with relevant Software or Technical Support. Without access to this
          Data, we may not be able to verify your compliance with this
          Agreement, among other things.
        </div>
        <div>
          By entering into this agreement or using the Software or Technical
          Support, you and your users agree to the collection, processing,
          copying, backup and storage of this Data in and from the United States
          or other countries or jurisdictions outside of your or your users’ own
          as part of the Software or Support.
        </div>
        <div>
          If you choose to have your personal information deleted from our
          database, please see our Privacy Policy
          (https://www.csiamerica.com/legal/privacy-policy). Please note that we
          may need to retain certain records for legal or internal business
          reasons and some of your information may remain on backup systems in
          compliance with applicable law. We encourage you promptly to update
          your personal information when it changes.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. You are not entitled to receive damages from
        Vendor for any cause relating to this Agreement, to your use of the
        Software, to any services provided by Vendor under this Agreement, or to
        any services provided by any third party in connection with your use of
        the Software. In addition, in no event shall you be entitled to obtain
        any injunctive relief or enjoin, restrain, or otherwise interfere with
        Vendor or with the distribution, operation, development, or performance
        of the Software or any related products. IN NO EVENT SHALL VENDOR BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR
        INABILITY TO USE, THE SOFTWARE. IN NO EVENT SHALL VENDOR BE LIABLE FOR
        ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES
        FOR LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS, OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES,
        REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY UNDER WHICH SUCH DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT, AND
        EVEN IF ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. AS SOME
        STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR
        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION
        MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
      </li>
      <li>
        LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. Vendor warrants that, as of the date on
        which the Software is purchased and for sixty (60) days thereafter
        (“Warranty Period”), the Software will provide the general features and
        functions described in the Documentation in effect on the date of
        purchase. Vendor's entire liability and your exclusive remedy during the
        Warranty Period (“Limited Warranty”) will be, with the exception of any
        statutory warranty or remedy that cannot be excluded or limited under
        law, at Vendor's option, (i) to attempt to correct or work around
        errors, if any, or (ii) to refund the license fees, if any, paid by you
        and terminate this Agreement or the license specific to such Software.
        Such refund is subject to the discontinuance of the use of the Software,
        deactivation of the license key per instructions provided by Vendor,
        destroying all printed copies and deleting all electronic copies of any
        documentation that you have downloaded, printed, or created relating to
        the Software, and ensuring that no copies of any of the Software
        screens, data, or other content remain archived or otherwise stored on
        your computers, during the Warranty Period, and providing declaration of
        same to Vendor. THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION GIVES YOU
        SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER LAW
        WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. VENDOR DOES NOT SEEK TO
        LIMIT YOUR WARRANTY RIGHTS TO ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW.

        <br />
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, VENDOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY
        AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, AS WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES ALLEGED TO HAVE ARISEN FROM CUSTOM,
        USAGE, OR THE COURSE OF DEALING BETWEEN THE PARTIES. VENDOR DOES NOT
        WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR
        REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED
        OR ERROR-FREE. IN ADDITION, VENDOR DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT
        YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SOFTWARE AT ALL TIMES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
        ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INTERNET CONGESTION AND OUTAGES, AS WELL AS
        MAINTENANCE, DOWNTIME, AND OTHER INTERRUPTIONS, MAY INTERFERE AT TIMES
        WITH YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE SOFTWARE.
        <br />
        In no event shall Vendor or its suppliers be liable for any damages
        whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business
        profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other
        pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use this
        Software, even if Vendor has been advised of the possibility of such
        damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
        liability for consequential damages, the above limitation may not apply
        to Licensee.
      </li>
      <li>
        GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by and
        be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
        without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        FORCE MAJEURE. If the performance of Vendor under this Agreement is
        prevented, hindered, or otherwise made impractical by reason of flood,
        strike, war, acts of government, or any other casualty or cause beyond
        the control of Vendor, then Vendor shall be excused from its performance
        to the extent and so long as it is prevented, hindered, or delayed by
        such event(s).
      </li>
      <li>
        SEVERABILITY. If any one or more of the provisions contained in this
        Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal, or
        unenforceable in any respect, then to the maximum extent permitted by
        law, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect
        any other provision of this Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        NO ASSIGNMENT. You may not assign this Agreement or any of the rights
        granted by Vendor hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior
        written consent of Vendor, and any attempt to do so shall be void. This
        Agreement is binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
        and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
      </li>
      <li>
        ATTORNEYS FEES. In the event of legal action brought by either party,
        the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of actual legal
        fees and related expenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        MODIFICATION. This Agreement may be modified or amended at the sole
        discretion of Vendor.
      </li>
      <li>
        EXPORT CONTROL. You agree to obey and comply with any and all applicable
        United States laws, rules, and regulations governing the export of
        software.
      </li>
      <li>
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND EXCLUSIVITY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS
        AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND
        CONDITIONS. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT IT IS THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE
        STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND VENDOR, AND THAT IT
        SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL, PRIOR AGREEMENT, OR UNDERSTANDING, ORAL OR
        WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU AND VENDOR RELATING TO
        THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE CHANGED,
        ALTERED, OR MODIFIED EXCEPT IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE PARTIES.
